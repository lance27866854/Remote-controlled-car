# Remote-controlled-car

This is the final project of Hardware Design And Lab course. My group partner and I planed to design a remote-controlled car together, and implemented it on FPGA board. I did some parts including the interface design, the NECIR decoder and the control system of modes. The NECIR decoder is the most intricated part. Every person interesting in Digital Design must know that circuit designs especially large ones need to be test again and again, and the process of trial and error is vital. I put a lot of strength on debuging on NECIR decoder, and I thought that's exhausted and a annoying task. Then I published the code and hoped that it would be helpful to someone in need.
